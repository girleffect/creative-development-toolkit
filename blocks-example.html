                            we see this stage as a collective effort to develop clear, focused objectives for the
                            project.</p>

                        <p>Getting to a clear, well focused research brief can be a challenging process, and often
                            involves having challenging conversations at the start of the research. However, it’s
                            critical to the success of the project and if you get it right - you’ll be able to design a
                            better methodology and get more helpful insights. </p>

                                            comes down to 3 big questions:</p>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>What are you trying to learn?</li>
                                            <li>How will this learning inform and influence the creative idea?</li>
                                            <li>What would success look like?</li>
                                        </ol>

                                            Sum up all your thinking into a written document or research brief.</p>
                                        <p>There is a research brief template in the Resources section.</p>
                                        <p>A few practical tips:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Keep it simple: a common mistake is to include too much internal detail
                                                which can overcomplicate. Your brief is a starting point for
                                                conversation with people outside of your team or organisation, and
                                                should plainly state your need for research
                                            </li>
                                            <li>A honest brief: try to approach it in a collaborative way, if there are
                                                tough political decisions to be made or choices you’re not sure about –
                                                spell them out in the brief: be clear about what’s unclear.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Iterate: the brief is your current best thinking on the need and
                                                approach for research, and it should be an evolving document. Leave
                                                space for others to challenge, build on and respond to your brief in
                                                unexpected ways
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Be aware of your own assumptions: remember you’ll also bring all of your
                                                own assumptions to the table. Write them down, see if they contain a
                                                point of view. If not, put them to one side, but just be aware of them.
                                            </li>

                                        <p>A brief is more than a document. It requires dialogue between researchers and

                                        <p>To get to the clearest set of objectives it’s important to stress-test and
                                            challenge the thinking you’ve laid out in the brief. You need to check
                                            you’ve
                                            considered all options, that you’re not missing anything and that you have
                                            good
                                            idea of what the top priorities for the research are.

                                        <p>Need help? A simple way of doing this is to run your brief through a few
                                            filter
                                            questions. There are three key questions to make sure you’re on the right
                                            track.

                                        <p>In creative development research it’s vital to understand and immerse
                                            yourself
                                            in the creative work. As a researcher, if you understand the thinking behind
                                            the
                                            creative you’ll have a much better idea of what to look out for and how to
                                            help.</p>


                                        <p>There are a couple of different ways to get to this: a briefing meeting
                                            between
                                            the teams, a creative briefing document (or any background on the creative -
                                            creative see Yegna TV series creative brief), or even interviewing members
                                            of
                                            the creative and production to team about the idea(s).</p>

                                        <p>Questions you might cover with the creative team include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The rationale behind each creative idea</li>
                                            <li>What hypotheses the team have about how the idea should work</li>

                                            <li>What they’re unsure about or decisions they’re hoping research can

                                                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> we recommend the researchers write <strong><i>a

                                                    have your own (sometimes strong) reactions to the creative ideas.
                                                    Think about why you’re reacting this way – what assumptions and
