                                    <p>Traditionally a brief would be defined as “information given to a researcher
                                        outlining
                                        the
                                        client’s reasons for requiring research” (Association for Qualitative Research).
                                        At
                                        Girl
                                        Effect
                                        we see this stage as a collective effort to develop clear, focused objectives
                                        for
                                        the
                                        project.</p>

                                    <p>Getting to a clear, well focused research brief can be a challenging process, and
                                        often
                                        involves having challenging conversations at the start of the research. However,
                                        it’s
                                        critical to the success of the project and if you get it right - you’ll be able
                                        to
                                        design a
                                        better methodology and get more helpful insights. </p>

                                                        Traditionally we used ‘snowballing’ recruitment methods –
                                                        contacting a local member of the community and finding
                                                        appropriate respondents from there. This is done differently in
                                                        different countries and contexts, its best to ask how different

                                                        youth – i.e. care should be taken that ‘articulate’ and
                                                        ‘confident’ doesn’t lead to excluding out-of-school girls.

                                                        found that girls in Mumbai were familiar with empowerment
                                                        messages in media, but felt that it was their mothers, aunts and
                                                        grandmothers who were holding them back. There was a clear
                                                        rationale for talking to gatekeepers thoroughly in the next

                                                        gatekeepers may be covered with a very small number of

                                                        In the prototyping phase, the emphasis is moving from stretching
                                                        to testing ideas – and hence it becomes more important to have a

                                                        As with prototyping you should ideally seek out a representative

                                                        gatekeepers may find it culturally inappropriate – it’s possible

                                    <p>The goal is to find the best way to talk to people about the ideas in play. Where
                                        would this conversation be most comfortable and interesting? When is the right
                                        moment for it? Whom should we talk to – individuals, small or large groups? How
                                        should we encourage them to talk about it? And how much (given that sometimes
                                        you learn more by watching what people do than listening to what they say).</p>

                                        responses from young people who may struggle to articulate their feedback.

                                                    <p>The answer to this question largely depends on how ‘ready’ your

                                                    <p>As a creative idea becomes more developed, the answer becomes

                                            research</strong>

                                        When trying to explore the ‘concept’ of Yegna to an audience in a region of
                                        Ethiopia that were unfamiliar with the brand, we used existing Yegna materials
                                        (music, video, images) as stimulus. We found that participants were honing in
                                        too narrowly on evaluating the stimulus independently, instead of conceptually.

                                        Instead of showing each piece individually and asking for comments (which
                                        created a ‘stop/start’ discussion), we tried presenting the radio drama,
                                        talkshow and music video consecutively to ‘immerse’ respondents and prompt a
                                        fuller discussion geared towards letting the respondents tell us what they found
                                        most interesting. We then included specific probes by format to ensure detail on
                                        all media was captured
                                    </p>

                                    <p>A discussion guide acts as a detailed outline for what you’re going to discuss
                                        with your respondents and how you’re going to go about doing it. It will be used
                                        alongside stimulus so it’s good, but not essential to know what stimulus you’ll
                                        have before developing the guide. Once your stimulus is finalised you should
                                        revisit your discussion guide to make sure it is optimised for the stimulus.</p>

                                            engagement or appeal of

                                                        Fieldwork can be fun, insightful, challenging, but sometimes also overwhelming and chaotic – here are a few tips for managing fieldwork to make
                                                        sure you get the most from it.</p>

                                                    <p><strong><i>Carefully brief your field team:</i></strong> ensure researchers are testing and probing with a purpose, and not just checking for
                                                        comprehension, engagement
                                                        or appeal of the idea</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        <strong><i>Be flexible:</i></strong> stay agile in field. If your methodology or questions aren’t getting the best responses try mixing up the
                                                        guide or a different
                                                        format. Each project is different, and you never get it 100% right in the research design. We recommend piloting the approach and working
                                                        closely with the moderator.

                                                        <strong><i>Expect and acknowledge problems:</i></strong> Few projects run totally smoothly. Some bumps along the way won’t affect the outcome,
                                                        but others will: a group

                                                        but it’s better to acknowledge and work with them. If things have gone really wrong – consider re-running a session if possible or placing
                                                        caveats around the findings if not. Create a climate where people are comfortable being open in this way.

                                                    <p>A recap on some fundamentals of moderation:</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Don’t lead the witness.</strong>
                                                        The information you get won’t truly reflect the respondent’s point of view if you use questions to guide them to the answers you want to hear.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p><strong>Use open questions.</strong> Avoid questions that beg a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answer; “Do you...”, “Are you...”, “Did you...”, etc. Ask questions
                                                        that start with: Who, what, where, why and when. You can probe deeper by asking them to: Tell us more, or explain what you mean. This offers
                                                        more opportunity for explanation or conversation rather than one-word answers.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><strong>Listen to the interviewee. </strong> Sometimes you get more information by paying attention to what they are not saying. Don’t interrupt
                                                        or finish their sentence.</p>

                                                    <p><strong>Show that you are interested.</strong> Use non-verbal cues such as eye contact, nodding and smiling to reassure the person you are
                                                        engaged and interested in what they are saying.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><strong>Respect their time and space</strong> . Agree on the outset how long you need. Finish on time and always ‘negotiate’ more time if you
                                                        need it. Always ask if you can take photographs of their personal space, and the objects in it. </p>

                                                    <p><strong>Endure the awkward silence.</strong> It is okay if there is silence during the interview. Give people time to think rather than fill the
                                                        silence with your own voice.</p>

                                                    <p><strong>Maintain energy.</strong> Maintaining high energy levels throughout the activity is crucial. The activity should not feel like work, it
                                                        should be fun. Participants should be engaged, sharing information on their terms, even if you are talking to an expert. If the energy is
                                                        getting low, do an energiser. See the <u>Activities and Exercises in the Discussion Guide section for energizers and warm ups.</u>

                                                        When researching creative ideas, there are particular moderation challenges and principles to bear in mind.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><strong><u>For Concept Development research (when your idea is still just an idea, and not yet a tangible execution):</u></strong></p>
                                                    <p><strong>Remember the ‘stimulus effect’</strong></p>
                                                    <p>At this stage we’re not researching finished executions, but often more abstract ideas that may not yet be expressed in terms that make sense to
                                                        the target audience. You’ll need to separate out problems with the stimulus or expression of the idea (the stimulus effect) with problems with
                                                        the idea’s fundamental potential. </p>
                                                    <p><strong>Approach it with a collaborative spirit:</strong></p>
                                                    <p>Invite Creatives to the sessions and find points where they can join in – e.g. working directly with respondents at the end of sessions to build
                                                        and remake ideas. Encourage respondents to recognize that they are creative contributors and help them to enjoy thinking inventively. Start the
                                                        session with creative thinking exercises and throw in energisers mid-way as necessary. Set up the room in a way that reflects this – that
                                                        respondents should feel free to contribute, critique, let go and enjoy themselves. Not a school room. </p>

                                                    <p><strong>A skilled moderator</strong></p>
                                                    <p>Moderating concept development groups requires a broad range of skills and techniques. Moderators need to help respondents to absorb new and
                                                        perhaps sometimes provocative ideas. They need to stretch respondents thinking, to think creatively, sometimes laterally about what a ‘build’ on
                                                        an idea could be. They have to help contextualize stimulus and encourage respondents to look past the shortcomings of early stage stimulus.
                                                        Moderating means looking for hidden potential in the ideas people reject and tactfully challenging people to see if there are downsides to the
                                                        ones they love, it means not shutting things down.</p>

                                                        Many of our teen respondents will be unused to meeting new people or critiquing new media ideas. However well-recruited and moderated the groups
                                                        are, conversations may often be hesitant and stilted. So sometimes we have to look for the answers in the small clues respondents can give us,
                                                        and in what they do as well as say….The words “I like it” may seem a limited response. But they mean a lot coming after the first time the group
                                                        has been filled with laughter and when you notice the teens singing the words of the chorus on their way out of the group.

                                                    <p><strong>A few tips for successful observation:</strong><br>

                                                        <i>Hypotheses:</i> write down a list of expected or ideal reactions for your different bits of stimulus – what do you want people to do and say
                                                        when they consume it? This way you are more attuned to things that surprise, disappoint or excite you.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>Capture observations: make detail notes of everything that’s happening, even if you don’t know what it means yet. It will also allow you to
                                                        compare reactions across the groups. If you’re going to record the group on audio or video, do so once the atmosphere is more comfortable or
                                                        you’ve seen their natural reaction. A useful tool that can be referred back to in analysis is to divide note page intro 3 columns: ‘what is
                                                        said’ /’what this means’/ what we see or is happening – <u>See Taking Good Notes exercise sheet</u></p>

                                                    <p><i>Do it outside of the formal group time:</i> you get the most genuine reactions when you don’t formalize the observation or observation
                                                        session. For example, as girls and boys arrive, you could have your magazines scattered around the room, and as they wait for the session to
                                                        begin see if and how they interact with them. Or replay the music video after the session has ended and see if they want to stick around, they
                                                        may reveal more genuine reactions after the session has ‘ended’. Chatting to and hanging out with respondents before and after a session breaks
                                                        the ice, and also lets you notice natural behavior. </p>

                                                    <p>For instance, when testing an idea for a football-based drama during Open Studios in Nigeria it was interesting to see the girls starting to play
                                                        football with the boys after the end of the session. </p>

                                                        taking them as creative recommendations. For example, if they suggest changing the looks or styling of one your characters, it is often more
                                                        valuable to find out why they have suggested this rather than taking the suggestion at face value. Is it because the character looks too urban?
                                                        Too village? Too old or young? This gives the creatives clearer direction for change.</p>

                                    <p>The part where the researchers come together as a group after reviewing their notes, and try to organise and make sense of the information gathered during the
                                        fieldwork. It’s one of the most important and difficult parts of being a researcher, and good analysis often comes with a lot of experience or training.</p>

                                                        There are of course many ways to do this – from coding and counting transcripts, through to a team discussion with post-it notes or a flipchart.
                                                        It varies from project to project, and there are key differences in how you might apply it to creative development research, compared to a
                                                        formative research project, for example.

                                                    <p>For Creative Development Research, it is important that the product or idea frames our analysis.</p>


                                                    <p>We should also have a number of specific hypotheses / key questions that came with the brief (e.g. do people understand the story of Zathu coming
                                                        together, do both urban and rural audiences warm to the band’s styling…) These are our other main starting point for analysis.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        <strong>Be analytical, but be positive</strong> – Analysis in creative development research often requires both critical and creative thinking.
                                                        It’s important to
                                                        understand why an idea doesn’t work and to be able to explain this logically, but we also need to problem solve, to say what would get an idea
                                                        to work better. The best creative development researchers want to see ideas succeed and are curious about looking for solutions.

                                                    <p><strong>Make use of serendipity </strong>– The mis-recruited group, the respondents who misunderstood the stimulus, the random conversation that
                                                        occurred whilst
                                                        waiting after the group for a delayed minibus – occasionally the left-field moments in creative development provide the fresh direction we are
                                                        looking for. Look out for and consider unexpected moments around the research… stay open to the unusual.</p>

                                                    <p>So in creative development analysis the process is likely to look like this:</p>

                                                    <p>However, the role of the debrief is not to provide the ‘final answer’. Our job is to explain what is working, what is not, and to provide advice
                                                        on
                                                        the way forward. While we want to provide clear direction on where to go next, the final decision is left to the creatives.</p>


                                                    <p>With this in mind we tend to use quite straight forward template for creative development debriefs - that encourage us to distill the complexity

                                    <p><strong><i>Be positive. Focus on what can be changed </i></strong> acknowledge the mindset of your audience. Especially during the later phases of research there
                                        can be concern that they’ll receive a host of suggestions to change things it’s too late to change. A useful trick to start the debrief with tactical
                                        suggestions for improvement, followed by bigger thoughts to come back to.</p>

                                    <p><strong><i>Provide evidence </i></strong> – Creative development research can leave you with strong, vivid impressions. Keep looking back to the data to check
                                        that these are representative and real. Are there quotes and examples to support the point? Are there counter-examples to consider? Make sure you are
                                        illustrating your conclusions and recommendations with quotes, pictures, clips that come directly from the audience. </p>

                                    <p><strong>Avoid reportage without recommendations </strong> - this should be clear from the reporting structure but - creative development research is partly about
                                        describing audience’s reactions to an idea, but the best research doesn’t stop there. Your analysis should describe not just what people thought and felt, but
                                        why they thought and felt this way and what this means for what we do next. Where reactions in research are good how can we make sure we replicate this in real
                                        life launch? When reactions are challenging, how can we solve the problems?

                                            <p>Simply put, 'creative development research' is research that supports the development of a creative idea – a new product, media content or campaign
                                                activity.
                                                It
                                                is mostly qualitative, though occasionally more quantitative methods are used as additional tools.</p>

                                            <p>It’s helpful to think of creative development research as different from the other types of qualitative research that GE do, in particular ‘formative
                                                research’.
                                                Of
                                                course, there are some fundamental similarities between the two types of research: in both cases, we are seeking to understand the audience’s point of
                                                view
                                                as
                                                fully
                                                and honestly as possible - to see the world through their eyes so that we can make media and messages that are relevant and engaging.</p>


                                            <p>However, there are some important differences. Creative development research often requires a different mind-set, set of tools or different application
                                                of
                                                methods,
                                                as shown on the following page.</p></div>

                                                    looking at
                                                    research.”

                                                    <p>Formative research often deals the opportunity to start from scratch – putting together a brief and approach that allows you to come up with the
                                                        most comprehensive answer.</p>


                                                    <p>When it comes to creative development research however, we are dealing with the fast-moving, and some times difficult-to-pin down space between
                                                        an
                                                        early idea and a final product. This means working with the best representation of the idea available (stimulus) rather than the final product.
                                                        It
                                                        can also mean creative ideas are moving forward or changing as we research. Typically, budgets and timelines are more restricted than we’d
                                                        like.</p>


                                                    <p>Creative development research is about working within the limitations of the project to come up with the best possible solution. We need
                                                        constantly
                                                        be asking ourselves ‘‘how can we…?’’ How can we best demonstrate the feeling of the video, without having the final product’, ‘how can we give
                                                        team
                                                        a helpful answer within the time and budget available’.</p>


                                                    <p>This does not mean less rigour – we still want an approach that is thoughtful, careful and rigorous, but it does mean approaching it with a
                                                        pragmatic eye. Along with asking yourself what is the ‘ideal way’, we also need to be asking ‘what is the best possible way’: what is the
                                                        highest
                                                        level of rigour we can bring to the research, with the resources available.</p>


                                                    <p>This also means not trying to answer questions we can’t answer with the resources available. A good creative approach tries to patch up the gaps
                                                        with a creative methodology, but has an awareness of the limitations that tight timelines and stimulus bring.</p>

                                                    <p>A common shortcoming of creative development research is that it tests an idea – whether people understand it, if they are interested in it –
                                                        without getting the real brand or creative objectives that need to be answered. For example: girls might understand a radio episode but is it
                                                        tackling the sensitive issue appropriately? Young people might like the theme tune, but does it feel distinct enough from what’s out there.</p>

                                                    <p>In all types of research, we must recognize the difference between what people say and what we think they mean – it’s best practice. However, in
                                                        creative development research we need to be especially aware of this for three reasons</p>


                                                    <p>Respondents know how they feel about an idea, but not necessarily how to develop or improve it</p>


                                                    <p>When you show respondents an idea, they know whether they’re uncomfortable with it, bored by it or simply do not understand it. This is something
                                                        they feel instinctively. However, most people find it much harder to suggest fixes for an idea that isn’t working. Here, the creative teams may
                                                        know
                                                        best. When people make suggestions to change things, our job is less about taking note of their ideas and more about understand the reasons
                                                        behind
                                                        this.</p>


                                                    <p>Gut reactions are often the most genuine</p>


                                                    <p>When we show people new ideas, they often feel an obligation to respond to all of our questions, and fill the allotted time – this means we can
                                                        get
                                                        responses that are over-considered, driven by politeness, groupthink and other social or cultural factors.</p>


                                                    <p>This means initial responses are often the most telling – In this case our job is to find evidence of this in what they tell us, and what they
                                                        show
                                                        us – is room buzzing with energy or does it fall flat? Unlike other subjects, often in creative development research, the longer you talk about

                                                    <p>But some ideas need time</p>


                                                    <p>However, disruptive ideas can need more time: GE aim to create change, sometimes the ideas we present may initially make people uncomfortable,
                                                        confused or surprised. We need to recognize these reactions, but be aware they can also be positive signs. Sometimes the best ideas are the ones
                                                        with most tension as they create debate. Our role as creative development research moderators it to explore this.</p>

                                    <h1>Knowing when to do creative development research</h1>

                                    <p>Creative development research lives in the space between having an idea and launching it.</p>


                                    <p>This space is constantly moving, and sometimes tricky-to-navigate, but the summary below should help.</p>


                                    <p>This is Girl Effect’s typical brand development journey, which includes key stages from developing your brand strategy through to launching your brand. Below that it maps the kinds of research that are most helpful at each stage. Creative development research is most helpful during design and creation stages to help design and develop your ideas.</p>


                                    <p>This journey is similar for other types of creative idea – a new product, media or campaign. While each journey is unique, the overall process for developing a creative is similar: you start with an idea, you develop it, consider different routes and then optimise and launch it.</p>

                                    <p>While all research seeks to support the brand with culturally relevant audience insights, strictly speaking ‘creative development research’ is the part in the middle: testing and developing the creative.</p>

                                    <p>There’s a lot of buzz around ‘co-creation’ in research, but with this hype comes fuzziness about what we mean and how exactly to do it.</p>


                                    <p>In a sense all research is co-creation - asking respondents to help us develop and improve our ideas.</p>

                                    <p>If we strip it back, it really comes down to two things: We expect our respondents to do more more work and contribute more, and we expect to push ideas further
                                        forward
                                        during a co-creation project than we would in other kinds of research.</p>


                                    <p>This approach is best used in cases where you want build a closer relationship between your creative team and audience (allowing them to work together) or in
                                        situations
                                        where there is more pressure on the creative, for example a complex market where you need to really stand out or break the mold for your idea to have an
