                                    <h1>What is creative development research?</h1>

                                    <p>Simply put, 'creative development research' is research that supports the development of a creative idea – a new product, media content or campaign
                                        activity.
                                        It
                                        is mostly qualitative, though occasionally more quantitative methods are used as additional tools.</p>

                                    <p>It’s helpful to think of creative development research as different from the other types of qualitative research that GE do, in particular ‘formative
                                        research’.
                                        Of
                                        course, there are some fundamental similarities between the two types of research: in both cases, we are seeking to understand the audience’s point of
                                        view
                                        as
                                        fully
                                        and honestly as possible - to see the world through their eyes so that we can make media and messages that are relevant and engaging.</p>


                                    <p>However, there are some important differences. Creative development research often requires a different mind-set, set of tools or different application
                                        of
                                        methods,
                                        as shown on the following page.</p></div>

                                            “A distinction between formative and creative development research is important as each requires a slightly different set of skills or way of
                                            looking at
                                            research.”

                                            <p>Formative research often deals the opportunity to start from scratch – putting together a brief and approach that allows you to come up with the
                                                most comprehensive answer.</p>


                                            <p>When it comes to creative development research however, we are dealing with the fast-moving, and some times difficult-to-pin down space between
                                                an
                                                early idea and a final product. This means working with the best representation of the idea available (stimulus) rather than the final product.
                                                It
                                                can also mean creative ideas are moving forward or changing as we research. Typically, budgets and timelines are more restricted than we’d
                                                like.</p>


                                            <p>Creative development research is about working within the limitations of the project to come up with the best possible solution. We need
                                                constantly
                                                be asking ourselves ‘‘how can we…?’’ How can we best demonstrate the feeling of the video, without having the final product’, ‘how can we give
                                                team
                                                a helpful answer within the time and budget available’.</p>


                                            <p>This does not mean less rigour – we still want an approach that is thoughtful, careful and rigorous, but it does mean approaching it with a
                                                pragmatic eye. Along with asking yourself what is the ‘ideal way’, we also need to be asking ‘what is the best possible way’: what is the
                                                highest
                                                level of rigour we can bring to the research, with the resources available.</p>


                                            <p>This also means not trying to answer questions we can’t answer with the resources available. A good creative approach tries to patch up the gaps
                                                with a creative methodology, but has an awareness of the limitations that tight timelines and stimulus bring.</p>

                                            <p>Creative development research means working with creatives, who are agile by nature. They pivot constantly, develop, test, iterate new products
                                                rapidly, and want to see and react to findings fast. This is increasingly the case as we work with ideas that are digital and be easily

                                            <p>This means working closely with the creative, production and brand teams to develop approaches that are thorough, but fleet of foot, allowing you
                                                to
                                                adapt to changes as the creative ideas develop, and early findings suggest a change in direction.</p>


                                            <p>Looking to the future, this also means being comfortable with quicker, more responsive research than the traditional 4-to-6 week

                                            <p>A common shortcoming of creative development research is that it tests an idea – whether people understand it, if they are interested in it –
                                                without getting the real brand or creative objectives that need to be answered. For example: girls might understand a radio episode but is it
                                                tackling the sensitive issue appropriately? Young people might like the theme tune, but does it feel distinct enough from what’s out there.</p>


                                            <p>The best creative development research doesn’t just test, it tests with a purpose. It’s key for the whole team to ensure that the research is
                                                fully
                                                anchored in the creative ideas and underlying purpose of project. This allows researchers to turn audience feedback into fresh briefings and
                                                direction for developing the idea.</p>

                                            <p>In all types of research, we must recognize the difference between what people say and what we think they mean – it’s best practice. However, in
                                                creative development research we need to be especially aware of this for three reasons</p>


                                            <p>Respondents know how they feel about an idea, but not necessarily how to develop or improve it</p>


                                            <p>When you show respondents an idea, they know whether they’re uncomfortable with it, bored by it or simply do not understand it. This is something
                                                they feel instinctively. However, most people find it much harder to suggest fixes for an idea that isn’t working. Here, the creative teams may
                                                know
                                                best. When people make suggestions to change things, our job is less about taking note of their ideas and more about understand the reasons
                                                behind
                                                this.</p>


                                            <p>Gut reactions are often the most genuine</p>


                                            <p>When we show people new ideas, they often feel an obligation to respond to all of our questions, and fill the allotted time – this means we can
                                                get
                                                responses that are over-considered, driven by politeness, groupthink and other social or cultural factors.</p>


                                            <p>This means initial responses are often the most telling – In this case our job is to find evidence of this in what they tell us, and what they
                                                show
                                                us – is room buzzing with energy or does it fall flat? Unlike other subjects, often in creative development research, the longer you talk about
                                                something the less depth you get.</p>


                                            <p>But some ideas need time</p>


                                            <p>However, disruptive ideas can need more time: GE aim to create change, sometimes the ideas we present may initially make people uncomfortable,
                                                confused or surprised. We need to recognize these reactions, but be aware they can also be positive signs. Sometimes the best ideas are the ones
                                                with most tension as they create debate. Our role as creative development research moderators it to explore this.</p>
