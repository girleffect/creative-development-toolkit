                            <p>Asking people to put their feelings into words is in itself a challenge. Particularly as what we show them becomes increasingly visual and emotive. Girl Effect’s work
                                with vulnerable young people only adds to the challenge:
                            </p>


                            <p>Teens often are reluctant to open up and talk expansively</p>

                            <p>Language barriers mean we sometimes miss out on the nuance and context of what little is said about an idea - ‘it’s good’ can mean ‘it’s different’</p>

                            <p>Power dynamics and sensitivity come into play when we send researchers into field to speak with vulnerable audiences, limiting communication or willingness to criticise
                                ideas</p>

                            <p><strong>We need to find tools to get to more nuanced emotional responses.</strong></p>

                            <p>There’s a lot of buzz around ‘co-creation’ in research, but with this hype comes fuzziness about what we mean and how exactly to do it.</p>


                            <p>In a sense all research is co-creation - asking respondents to help us develop and improve our ideas.</p>

                            <p>If we strip it back, it really comes down to two things: We expect our respondents to do more more work and contribute more, and we expect to push ideas further forward
                                during a co-creation project than we would in other kinds of research.</p>


                            <p>This approach is best used in cases where you want build a closer relationship between your creative team and audience (allowing them to work together) or in situations
                                where there is more pressure on the creative, for example a complex market where you need to really stand out or break the mold for your idea to have an impact.</p>

                                            respondents to make lateral leaps and strategic evaluations. The results are rarely inspiring. Instead encourage respondents to build on our ideas, at

                                    quickly by internal sessions with creatives to rework the ideas, followed by reconvened sessions to develop and refine the new iterations”

                            <p>In formative and ethnographic research there’s a tendency to go above and beyond to conduct girl-led research, which gives respondents a sense of ownership over the
                                research. In creative development research this can be harder and can be overlooked.

                                Some of the most successful creative development research we’ve come across found ways to let respondents engage with the creative in their real lives, on their own
