                            <h1>Knowing when to do creative development research</h1>

                            <p>Creative development research lives in the space between having an idea and launching it.</p>


                            <p>This space is constantly moving, and sometimes tricky-to-navigate, but the summary below should help.</p>


                            <p>This is Girl Effect’s typical brand development journey, which includes key stages from developing your brand strategy through to launching your brand. Below that it
                                maps
                                the
                                kinds of research that are most helpful at each stage. Creative development research is most helpful during design and creation stages to help design and develop your
                                ideas.</p>


                            <p>This journey is similar for other types of creative idea – a new product, media or campaign. While each journey is unique, the overall process for developing a creative
                                is
                                similar: you start with an idea, you develop it, consider different routes and then optimise and launch it.</p>

                            <p>While all research seeks to support the brand with culturally relevant audience insights, strictly speaking ‘creative development research’ is the part in the middle: testing and developing the creative.</p>

                                                        challenge, reframe, refine and deepen your existing knowledge and hypotheses. For example, we may know that girls want more opportunities to
                                                        hear
                                                        from girls their own age, but when we test a concept that lets them do this directly we may learn that in fact they want the sharing to be

                                                    <p>Pretesting is usually the most time-pressured research, with deadlines looming and teams highly focused on launch. There is often pressure to

                                                        back early or give ‘key headlines’ immediately, rather than going through a typical analysis process. Your approach should be time efficient and
                                                        your analysis and delivery of results should be targeted.</p>

                                                    <p>There may be less buy-in from the creative teams to conduct research at this phase. The decision to pretest may be coming from head office, it
                                                        feels
                                                        most like a ‘test’ of creative’s work and teams may feel they have already co-created the idea with audience so why research now. And what if
                                                        research comes back recommending difficult changes that it’s too late to make or which contradict what we already know? These are understandable
                                                        concerns. You can help by making sure you know what they already know, focusing only on the most important potential changes and clearly
                                                        positioning
                                                        the research as focusing on the ‘stuff around the creative’ vs testing something that may be too late to change.</p>

                                                    <p>This requires taking a more pragmatic approach than prototyping research. Here you should really narrow the focus – explore the areas the brand

                                                        have the biggest concerns or questions about, look out for really significant concerns, and focus your research and recommendations around what
                                                        can
                                                        be changed. It can be helpful to create a clear list of: what is known vs questions they still have, things that can be changed and things that
                                                        are
                                                        fixed. This way you don’t waste time chasing up things you can’t fix or have already investigated. When reporting findings it helps to divide
                                                        these
                                                        clearly into quick wins and tweaks vs. larger thoughts for the future. This allows creatives to focus immediately on the former, before going
                                                        back
                                                        to investigate the latter at a later stage.</p>

                                                        positive
                                                        conversation, and allay any concerns about the content of the drama? Or how can other activity like social media set the tone of the debate to
                                                        support the drama.</p>
